# CryptoCache: hashed geocache locations

I got tired of muggles finding my geocaches... therefore I'm only sharing geocaches with their hash values to prevent people from looking up the coordinates. Find the cache first and then see if it matches with one of mine! Figuring out the hash algorithm is up to you!

Heavily work in progress, please don't try any funny stuff! Haven't gotten around to securing everything yet...

This page is deployed here: https://cryptocache.vercel.app

**Important disclaimer**: This is a project for a mystery geocache. Bad programming practices and security vulnerabilities are intentional and part of the cache!
